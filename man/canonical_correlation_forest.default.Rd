  nr_of_trees = 200, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{numeric matrix (n * p) with n observations of p variables}

\item{Y_one_hot}{muneric matrix with n observations of q variables
(one_hot_encoded)}

\item{nr_of_trees}{nr of trees the forest will be composed of}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\value{

where an object of this class is a list containing the following
components:
  \item{X,Y_one_hot}{The original input data}
  \item{forest}{a vector of length nr_of_trees with objects of class
   "canonical_correlation_tree"}
